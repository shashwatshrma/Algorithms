A data structure that keeps track of the representative element of connected nodes

## Usage
1. It is used to keep track of connected component in an undirected graph
2. It is used to detect cycles in the graph.

## Real Life Applications
1. Used in Kruskal's algorithm as we do not want cycles in Kruskal's.
