A minimum spanning tree greedy algorithm that fixes the node with the smallest distance in each iteration. Primâ€™s algorithm checks each edge once.

## Benefits
1. Beneficial if the graph is dense i.e. it contains a lot of edges as opposed to Kruskal's

## Shortcomings
1. Both Kruskal's and Prim's follow the greedy approach so in a complex network, the algorithm may get stuck in a local minima.

## Real Life Applications
1. Due to the aforementioned shortcoming, it is not used in practical applications.
