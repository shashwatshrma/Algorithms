It finds all pair shortest path by using a dynamic programming approach. It relaxes all the edges in the graph

## Benefits
1. Works better for dense graphs compared to Johnson's algorithm

## Shortcomings
1. It has a high time complexity

## Real Life Applications
1. In package delivery systems where we need the shortest path between all the stops.
